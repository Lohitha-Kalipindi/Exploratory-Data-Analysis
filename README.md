# 🚀 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

This repository covers essential steps in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to clean, explore, format, and visualize data for better insights.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- **DC (Data Cleaning)** 🧼 – Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
- **DE (Data Exploration)** 🔍 – Understanding data distribution, correlations, and summary statistics.  
- **DF (Data Formatting)** 🏗️ – Standardizing data types, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.  
- **DV (Data Visualization)** 📊 – Graphical representations of data using plots and charts.  

## 🔧 How to Use  
1. Load the dataset.  
2. Apply **DC, DE, DF,** and **DV** techniques.  
3. Extract insights for further analysis or model building.  

📊 **EDA is a crucial step before machine learning and decision-making!**
